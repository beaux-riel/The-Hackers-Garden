### Red Team - Physical
Physical red team attack tactics and techniques involve a variety of methods used to test the efficacy of physical security measures. These tactics are designed to simulate real-world attacks that could compromise physical barriers, gain unauthorized access, or expose vulnerabilities in security protocols. Below is a comprehensive list covering a range of physical red team attack tactics and techniques:

### 1. Reconnaissance and Pre-Attack Planning

- **Site Surveillance**: Observing the target location to understand security measures, entry/exit points, and guard routines.
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Gathering data from public sources to aid in planning the attack (e.g., social media, websites).
- **Physical Social Engineering**: Engaging with employees or security personnel to gather information without arousing suspicion.

### 2. Gaining Entry

- **Lock Picking**: Using lock picks to open mechanical locks without the original key.
- **Bypassing Electronic Locks**: Techniques to bypass electronic access controls, including RFID cloning and keypad guessing.
- **Tailgating and Piggybacking**: Following authorized personnel into secure areas without being noticed.
- **Badge Cloning**: Copying an employee's access badge using a card reader/writer to gain unauthorized access.
- **Forced Entry**: Physically breaking into a facility, though often avoided due to the risk of detection and legal consequences.

### 3. Evasion Techniques

- **Avoiding Surveillance**: Techniques to avoid detection by cameras and surveillance systems, including camera blind spots and disguise.
- **Social Engineering Uniforms**: Wearing uniforms or disguises to blend in with employees or contractors.
- **Distraction Tactics**: Creating a diversion to draw security personnel away from the point of entry or target area.

### 4. Surveillance and Eavesdropping

- **Deploying Listening Devices**: Placing bugs or audio devices to capture conversations or meetings.
- **Wi-Fi Interception**: Setting up devices to intercept or disrupt wireless communications.
- **Video Surveillance**: Installing hidden cameras to monitor sensitive areas or capture security procedures.

### 5. Physical Device Deployment

- **USB Drops**: Leaving USB drives with malicious software in hopes that employees will use them on internal computers.
- **Wireless Access Points**: Installing unauthorized wireless devices to create backdoors into the network.
- **Keyloggers**: Installing hardware keyloggers to capture keystrokes and gain access to sensitive information.

### 6. Document Exploitation

- **Document Theft**: Physically stealing documents or devices that contain sensitive information.
- **Dumpster Diving**: Searching through trash to find sensitive information that has not been properly disposed of.

### 7. Exit Techniques

- **Data Exfiltration**: Removing physical or digital copies of sensitive data from the premises.
- **Evidence Erasure**: Covering tracks to minimize any signs of the physical intrusion.
- **Exit Strategy Execution**: Leaving the premises without detection, using pre-planned exit routes or methods.

### 8. Post-Attack Actions

- **Debrief and Reporting**: Documenting the techniques used, vulnerabilities exploited, and recommendations for improving security.
- **Lessons Learned**: Analyzing the success and failures of the operation to refine techniques for future engagements.

This list encompasses a broad range of techniques that red teams might employ to test and improve physical security measures. It's important to note that all physical red team activities should be authorized, ethical, and conducted with the utmost respect for privacy and legality to ensure they contribute positively to an organization's security posture.
